## Project Description

<!-- Please fill in details about what you're trying to build. What is the purpose/context? What are the high-level requirements?

This section should be 2-3 paragraphs long. -->

We are building Peermaps, a distributed, offline-friendly alternative to commercial map providers such as Google Maps. Instead of fetching data from a centralized tile service, your computer fetches map data from other peers across the network. With the powerful inverse scaling dynamics of peer-to-peer, we can run a mapping platform at a fixed, modest cost, no matter how popular it becomes. 

We've developed a new standard format for map data that is better for decentralized contexts. [This specification can be found here.](https://github.com/peermaps/docs/blob/master/bufferschema.md) The original OSM data format is XML and is not great for random access or space efficiency. But both of these features -- small footprint and efficient access -- will be critical for practical use on a distributed storage network. A typical size for data in XML format is at least 87GB, and the OSM pbf format reduces it to 50GB. The peermaps format should be much smaller and faster by using compact buffers, triangulation, and clever indexing developed in Rust. 

This grant will help us use IPFS as a "hot" peer-to-peer storage network for Peermaps data for near-real-time access. This will be a premiere application built on IPFS that will greatly improve digital mapping. There is between 3-4GB of XML updated per week on OpenStreetMap -- we (bits.coop peermaps team) will run a node will download, diffs, and pack those changes into the Peermaps format on a regular basis. 

This script will also put OpenStreetMap data in the original (.pbf) format on the IPFS and Filecoin networks for cold storage, improving the overall resiliency and download speeds for the data. We figured this will be nice to do at the same time, since the processing node will have to downloading these large OSM files anyway, it would make sense to also upload the original (pre-processed) versions to IPFS and Filecoin.


## Value

<!-- Please describe why the work that will come out of this Targeted Grant is valuable for the IPFS ecosystem. -->


We will be able to lower costs for developers who are currently using embedded Google Maps or Mapbox, which both cost money per impression after a certain limit.

Currently a developer creating a website with a map will have to pay substantial money per impression.   For example,  1 million impressions * $0.07 = $70,000. Although there are often volume discounts, this gives you an idea of how expensive this can be for the unfortunately popular individual developer or small startup.

OpenStreetMap is an amazing example of public-interest technology and community-run critical digital infrastructure. They have managed to make a competitive product to Google maps, and they serve a substantial volume of requests. Decentralizing their storage -- both for hot and cold access -- could drastically lower costs for the community to maintain this public interest dataset. Peer to peer protocols like IPFS will be able to spread out the work of hosting very large files among all the participants in the network who are interested in a file. Centralized services can be overwhelmed if too many people want to download a file, but p2p services flip scaling on its head: the more people are downloading and sharing, the better the network works for everyone.

## Deliverables

<!-- What are you expecting the proposer to deliver at the completion of this project?-->


1. `peermaps/ingest`: A library for injesting and diffing OpenStreetMap data, handling periodic changes. This tool will convert OpenStreetMap into the Peermaps format. This deliverable is co-funded by this devgrant and SamsungNEXT;
2. Commandline tool using `peermaps/ingest` to diff .pbf files, convert to the Peermaps format, and pin both data formats on IPFS;
3. Commandline tool using `peermaps/ingest` .pbf files, convert to the Peermaps format, and pin both data formats on Filecoin 
4. Post about the project for the IPFS blog
5. Demo page with example code for map view in the browser using js-ipfs to fetch data.
6. Report on feasability, usability, experience building on Filecoin/IPFS apis.

## Detailed Requirements & Constraints
<!-- You can use this section to detail requirements that the deliverables must include.

Also include any relevant constraints that the implementer should be aware of before beginning this project.-->

We plan to run a node to process, diff, and host the data in the short term. This will be run on a computer every week. We can publish this on a collaborative cluster to make it easy for other folks to also host the subsequent data. If at some point we decide to shut off our node that processes & diffs, we will let Protocol Labs know -- and of course all the necessary tools will be open source.

A long-term goal of this project is to make this processing & indexing be
done with distributed computation, rather than on a single machine. Ideally,
other groups in maplandia would be interested in running the infra/CI and we
could share the computation load.

We'd also be happy to run the script on the IPFS collaborative cluster infra as
well: https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-01-09-collaborative-clusters/.
