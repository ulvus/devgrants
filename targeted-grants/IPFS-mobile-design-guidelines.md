# Open Grant Proposal: `IPFS mobile design guidelines`

**Name of Project:**

**Proposer:** `jkosem`

**Do you agree to open source all work you do on behalf of this RFP and dual-license under MIT and APACHE2 licenses?:** "Yes"

# Project Description

Following on the far-reaching initial efforts to bring about mass adoption of IPFS by creating browser design guidelines to be brought to standards bodies and browser vendors, it is clear the guidelines work needs to be expanded to where it could achieve adoption quickest, on mobile. Smartphone use has eclipsed desktop, especially in emerging markets, where IPFS stands to better address use cases, patterns and concerns around data sovereignty, offline applications and security.

This programme of work will include the design phase to follow on from the preceding research phase. It will include not just the design of use of mobile browser but wider mobile sharing and receiving workflows of iOS and Android mobile operating systems. This will provide a foundational effort towards IPFS on mobile platforms, informing both IPFS feature prioritisation and the ecosystem and community building on the protocol.

## Value

If the mobile design guidelines are not available, we risk application builders reinventing this design wheel over and over again, or shipping poorly designed IPFS-based products that don't meet user needs. This ultimately means less and less people would use IPFS. 

The value of the IPFS Mobile Design Guidelines is taking the research and analysis, synthesising it and then providing actionable principles for the development and design communities to act on in bringing IPFS mobile experiences to the world in the most user-friendly way possible.

The question of scope is constant in defining projects and areas of study. While the scope of this may initially be quite wide and shallow, this could be advantageous in setting up the groundwork for additional studies which would further refine thinking and recommendations as the field progresses. The value lies in making forays into the space, researching and designing that which has not been done to date, and creating a way to learn where to refine and redefine how IPFS is brought to more and more users.

## Deliverables

The deliverable is a repository and report of use-cases, design guidelines and UX patterns. This design direction would then be explored through iconography, interface and interaction design as expressed through the design and production of graphic assets. These assets, in accessible graphical formats in a version tracked repository, will then help form the recommendations half of the public and open source report, showing and inspiring designers how to design for IPFS in a mobile world.

## Development Roadmap

The following is the second of two phases of the rollout of the IPFS Mobile Design Guidelines. All of the research and design work is to be led or done by Jim Kosem with technical and project guidance and advice by Dietrich Ayala.

## Total Budget Requested

€14,160 EUR

No VAT charged (Reverse charge – VAT is not settled under Article 44 of Directive 2006/112/EC)

## Maintenance and Upgrade Plans

As the project is research and design based, there is no need for software maintenance. However, what will be produced and delivered are content and design repositories and documents which are to be open source, freely available to the public and to be maintained by Protocol Labs.
