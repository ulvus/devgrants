# ipfs-grants

Welcome to the IPFS Grant Platform! The Grant Platform connects grant makers with builders and researchers in the IPFS community. Whether you represent a foundation that wants to move the space forward, a company looking to accelerate development on the features your application needs, or a dev team itching to hack on IPFS tools, you've come to the right place. Take a look at the supported grant types and available funding + work opportunities below.

|:warning: The grants program has now [launched out of beta](https://blog.ipfs.io/2020-04-20-ipfs-grants-platform/) and has been a huge success. The IPFS team budget for grants in Q2 is now spent, and we are not funding any proposals not already in review until Q3 2020. This platform is still open for discussing grants for future funding, to submit proposals that could be funded from other interested parties, or to propose funding of your own for projects you'd like to see exist!|

## Grant Types

### Bounty
The bounty challenges are simply issues in IPFS-related repos that have a monetary reward associated with them. You don't need to propose a solution or spec out the work for these challenges⁠—simply submit a patch addressing the issue and you can claim the bounty once the PR is merged.

For a list of issues eligible for Bounties, award amounts, and more details see [BOUNTIES](BOUNTIES.md)

[**LIST OF BOUNTIES**](../../projects/1) • [**CLAIM A BOUNTY**](BOUNTIES.md#how-to-collect) • [**START A BOUNTY**](BOUNTIES.md#how-to-propose) • [Read More](BOUNTIES.md)

### RFP
Projects too large for a bounty are specified as RFPs and can range from more complex feature work on IPFS to entirely new tools and libraries. 

To see open RFPs and learn more about the proposal process see [RFPs](rfps). RFPs may be funded by Protocol Labs, other community members, or a consortium of interested parties.

### Open Grant
Do you have an idea for pushing the IPFS ecosystem forward not already covered by an RFP? Propose an open grant for consideration by the IPFS community.

To read more about creating an Open Grant proposal, see [OPEN GRANTS](open-grants).

[**See Proposed Open Grants**](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atype%3Aopen-grant+) • [**See Completed Open Grants**](open-grants/completed) • [**Apply for an Open Grant**](open-grants/README.md) • [Read More](open-grants/README.md)

### Adoption Microgrant
These are small grants intended to help stimulate experimentation with and adoption of IPFS across a wide range of fields. The application and reporting requirements are more relaxed, but the monetary awards are more limited ($1k).

To read more about Adoption Microgrants see [MICROGRANTS](MICROGRANTS.md). Adoption Microgrants are funded by Protocol Labs.

---

### Targeted Grant
These are grants negotiated directly with a recipient, rather than going through the usual RFP/open grant process. Targeted Grants are currently made by Protocol Labs.

[**See In-Progress Targeted Grants**](../../issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue+label%3Atype%3Atargeted-grant) • [**See Completed Targeted Grants**](targeted-grants/completed)

### Don't see your grant type?
Is your organization interested in offering a grant that doesn't fit into any of the above categories? Open a [META issue](https://github.com/protocol/ipfs-grants/issues/new?assignees=parkan&labels=&template=-meta--grant-platform-improvement.md&title) with your idea.
